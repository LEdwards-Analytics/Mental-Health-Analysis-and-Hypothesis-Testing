# Suicide Rate Analysis

Suicide Rates Around the World from 1985-2015

## Description

The main purpose of analyzing global suicides from 1958 to 2016 is to
answer a few questions that came to mind when seeing this data; How the rate
of suicide has changed over time, which gender is more likely to commit suicide
and if this varies around the world, and is there a correlation between GDP and
the suicide rates. The main reason I was interested in exploring this data was
to see the differences and similarities in the correlations so when similar data is
released in 2020, during the Covid pandemic, I’ll be able to understand how
it’s changed over time and have a better grasp of the data as a whole.

This is a research project from 2020, I may or may not contribute to it again but I needed to perform some cleaning up and formatting adjustments for it to be GitHub compatible and I'm uploading it for viewing.
